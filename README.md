# first-musketeer-website
Small website to expose our katas during salt training

# Steps:
* Setup the git repo with testing, initial setup and linting
* Create tests for the backend
    * Figure out how to test for API responses and structure.
* Create back-end with the following API structure:
    * api/calculator/
    * api/fizzbuzz/
    * api/prime-factors/
    * api/roman-numerals/
Create API for one function initially, making sure that only the right requests, paths and inputs are accepted, while handling as many possible errors as humanly possible.

* Design the front-end (HTML, CSS, JS)

* Once the full stack app is functioning as expected with one of the functions, then repeat for the rest of the functions we want to expose to the user.
